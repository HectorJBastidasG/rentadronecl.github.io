# Want to help with the translation?
If you feel okay with translating quite alone, you can fork the repo, post a comment on the [issues tracking](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/rentadronecl.github.io/issues) page to inform others that you're doing the translation and go for it.

And thank you in advance ;)
